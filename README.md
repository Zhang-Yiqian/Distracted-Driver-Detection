# Distracted-Driver-Detection
This is my graduate project, which is not a complex one. My main purpose is to get acquainted with Keras and tensorflow(I used to be a PyTorch user).
The data I used is from a kaggle competition (url:https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/kernels) that is about driver action recongnition, and I would like to finetune ResNet using this dataset.
I have to claim that this project is for my personal training, if I infringe your copyright, please let me know.

LET US GET STARTED!!
